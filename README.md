# AI-Driven Electricity Demand Forecasting System
An intelligent forecasting system that predicts electricity demand using ML, deep learning, and federated learning for improved grid planning and stability.

# About
The AI-Driven Electricity Demand Forecasting System is designed to predict future electricity consumption using advanced Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Federated Learning techniques. Traditional load forecasting methods struggle with non-linear patterns, seasonal variation, climate changes, and regional differences. This project solves these challenges by integrating an intelligent forecasting model that uses historical load data, weather features, and temporal attributes to generate highly accurate predictions.

The system enhances grid stability, supports decision-making for power utilities, reduces demand-supply imbalance, and enables scalable, privacy-preserving model training through federated learning. It is capable of real-time forecasting and performs exceptionally well in scenarios with fluctuating climate conditions and diverse regional load profiles.
